			<p>Just when all seems to be going well a new challenge appears presenting an opportunity to learn, grow, and adapt. Life has been altered for all of us presenting unique obstacles to be confronted. Our primary concern is for the safety, health, and well-being of our Seniors and particularly those for whom we have been entrusted to care. We care for each of the residents in our Community as if there were our own parents or grandparents; we take the responsibility we have been given very seriously.</p>
