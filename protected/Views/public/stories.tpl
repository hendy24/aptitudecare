				Hugging Wall

			</h2>
			<p class="text-semibold leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl"

				It had been months since many of our residents had felt physical touch from their families. We're all
				about bringing people together, and creating moments that build connection. This has been difficult
				lately. <span x-show="toggles.blurb1">
          <br><br>
          That's why we built The Hugging Wall. We wanted to create a fun, safe way that families could be close to their loved ones.
          <br><br>
This day went beyond even our wildest dreams. Tears, smiles, and laughter. Sons hugged mothers for the first time in 8 months. Daughters rubbed the shoulders of their fathers. One of our residents got to touch her new great-granddaughter for the first time. The feedback from the families was incredible. Many asked if we could make this a permanent feature!
          <br><br>
The feelings this event created were so memorable. Just another way we are working hard to foster connection.

				Spring Community Market

			</h2>
			<p class="text-semibold leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl"
			   style='font-family: "Raleway", sans-serif'>
				We're so thankful for the Anchorage community that made our Spring Market incredible! We had over 25
				local vendors and so many amazing people, goods, foods, and a huge selection of items to buy. It was
				heart-warming to see families together again, walking around and enjoying each other’s company while
				shopping.
				<span x-show="toggles.blurb5">
					<br>

					<strong>The backstory</strong>
					<br>
					<br>
					Because of COVID, over the last year we haven’t been able to bring our awesome residents out into
					the community for their normal shopping adventures. So, we thought, “why not bring the shopping to them!?”
					<br>
					<br>
					What began as an idea to bring a market shopping experience right here, for our residents, soon expanded into an
					awesome free event for the whole community! There was so much excitement about it, that we decided to invite even
					more vendors, and to open it up to all of Anchorage.
					<br>
					<br>
					The event was totally free and ended up being a huge success. Families came from all over town to eat, browse, and shop.
					We gave away prizes like a Yeti cooler, Xtratuf boots, Moose's Tooth gift cards, and more! Bringing people together is
					something we are passionate about.
					<br>
					<br>
					Aspen Creek is grateful to our awesome community and the amazing vendors that made this event possible!
